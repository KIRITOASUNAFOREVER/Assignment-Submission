Question 1:
for(i=1 ; i <= n; i++){
	for(j=i; j <= n;j++){
		printf("Hi");
	}
}

Explanation:
This nested loop is printing "Hi",it will do it for the number of times of outer loop, which itself runs for n length. hence, it will do the work for 1 + 2 + 3 + .....n times, which becomes n*(n+1)/2 times. Hence, it will simply be O(n^2).

Answer for Question 1:
So the time complexity will be O(n^2).

Question 2:
for(i=1; i<=n ;i*=3){
	for(j=1; j<=n ;j++){
		printf("Hello");
	}
}
Explanation:
there are two loops which are present. The first loop in the code snippet, the loop variable is multiplied by a constant value and hence the time complexity of the first loop is of O(log n). The second loop in the code snippet, the loop variable is increamented with a constant amount and hence the time complexity of the second loop is of O(n).

Answer for Question 2:
So the time complexity will be O(n*log n).
